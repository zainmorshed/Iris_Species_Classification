# Iris_Species_Classification
In this project, I delved into the iris species dataset, which showcases three distinct species of flowers.
The dataset provides measurements for key botanical features, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, all recorded in centimeters.
Leveraging these informative columns as features, the objective was to predict the specific species of each flower. To achieve this, I employed three different machine learning algorithms:
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and the Decision Tree Classifier. 
Through this exploration, the project aimed to harness the power of these algorithms to accurately classify the iris flowers based on their characteristic measurements.
